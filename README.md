Sahai, is an intelligent conversational AI system developed to automate and simplify hospital appointment scheduling.
In many hospitals, appointment booking is still handled manually at the reception desk. Patients are required to visit the hospital in person to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments, which leads to long waiting times, heavy workload on reception staff, and inefficiency during peak hours. These issues become more critical for elderly patients and people from rural areas.
To solve this problem, we designed an AI-powered conversational agent that assists hospitals in managing appointment-related tasks. Sahai provides a simple interface where patients can either chat or use voice input, making it accessible even for users who are not comfortable with typing. The system also supports multiple languages, including English and regional languages.
The AI understands the patient’s intent—such as booking, rescheduling, or canceling an appointment—and checks the availability of doctors based on the required specialty. It then displays available time slots, collects basic patient details, and confirms the appointment automatically.
This solution reduces waiting time, handles high patient load efficiently, and supports hospital staff without replacing them. Overall, Sahai improves accessibility, efficiency, and convenience in hospital appointment management.
